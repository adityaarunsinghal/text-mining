       "'Personality test OCEAN IPIP - NEO Narrative Report NOTE : The report sent to your computer screen upon the completion of the IPIP - NEO is only a temporary web page . When you exit your web browser you will not be able to return to this URL to re - access your report . No copies of the report are sent to anyone . IF YOU WANT A PERMANENT COPY OF THE REPORT , YOU MUST SAVE THE WEB PAGE TO YOUR HARD DRIVE OR OTHER STORAGE MEDIUM , AND / OR PRINT THE REPORT WHILE YOU ARE STILL VIEWING IT IN YOUR WEB BROWSER . Probably the best way to save the report is to select and copy the entire page ( Ctrl - A , Ctrl - C on most browsers ) , paste it into a word processor , and save the document . This report compares Adi from the country India to other males less than 21 years of age . ( The name used in this report is either a nickname chosen by the person taking the test , or , if a valid nickname was not chosen , a random nickname generated by the program . ) This report estimates the individual\\'s level on each of the five broad personality domains of the Five - Factor Model . The description of each one of the five broad domains is followed by a more detailed description of personality according to the six subdomains that comprise each domain . A note on terminology . Personality traits describe , relative to other people , the frequency or intensity of a person\\'s feelings , thoughts , or behaviors . Possession of a trait is therefore a matter of degree . We might describe two individuals as extraverts , but still see one as more extraverted than the other . This report uses expressions such as \" extravert \" or \" high in extraversion \" to describe someone who is likely to be seen by others as relatively extraverted . The computer program that generates this report classifies you as low , average , or high in a trait according to whether your score is approximately in the lowest 30 % , middle 40 % , or highest 30 % of scores obtained by people of your sex and roughly your age . Your numerical scores are reported and graphed as percentile estimates . For example , a score of \" 60 \" means that your level on that trait is estimated to be higher than 60 % of persons of your sex and age . Please keep in mind that \" low , \" \" average , \" and \" high \" scores on a personality test are neither absolutely good nor bad . A particular level on any trait will probably be neutral or irrelevant for a great many activities , be helpful for accomplishing some things , and detrimental for accomplishing other things . As with any personality inventory , scores and descriptions can only approximate an individual\\'s actual personality . High and low score descriptions are usually accurate , but average scores close to the low or high boundaries might misclassify you as only average . On each set of six subdomain scales it is somewhat uncommon but certainly possible to score high in some of the subdomains and low in the others . In such cases more attention should be paid to the subdomain scores than to the broad domain score . Questions about the accuracy of your results are best resolved by showing your report to people who know you well . John A . Johnson wrote descriptions of the five domains and thirty subdomains . These descriptions are based on an extensive reading of the scientific literature on personality measurement . Although Dr . Johnson would like to be acknowledged as the author of these materials if they are reproduced , he has placed them in the public domain . Extraversion Extraversion is marked by pronounced engagement with the external world . Extraverts enjoy being with people , are full of energy , and often experience positive emotions . They tend to be enthusiastic , action - oriented , individuals who are likely to say \" Yes ! \" or \" let us go ! \" to opportunities for excitement . In groups they like to talk , assert themselves , and draw attention to themselves . Introverts lack the exuberance , energy , and activity levels of extraverts . They tend to be quiet , low - key , deliberate , and disengaged from the social world . Their lack of social involvement should not be interpreted as shyness or depression ; the introvert simply needs less stimulation than an extravert and prefers to be alone . The independence and reserve of the introvert is sometimes mistaken as unfriendliness or arrogance . In reality , an introvert who scores high on the agreeableness dimension will not seek others out but will be quite pleasant when approached . DOMAIN / FacetScore ￼ EXTRAVERSION68 ￼ ... Friendliness78 ￼ ... Gregariousness72 ￼ ... Assertiveness77 ￼ ... Activity Level76 ￼ ... Excitement - Seeking42 ￼ ... Cheerfulness27 ￼ Your score on Extraversion is high , indicating you are sociable , outgoing , energetic , and lively . You prefer to be around people much of the time . Extraversion Facets Friendliness . Friendly people genuinely like other people and openly demonstrate positive feelings toward others . They make friends quickly and it is easy for them to form close , intimate relationships . Low scorers on Friendliness are not necessarily cold and hostile , but they do not reach out to others and are perceived as distant and reserved . Your level of friendliness is high . Gregariousness . Gregarious people find the company of others pleasantly stimulating and rewarding . They enjoy the excitement of crowds . Low scorers tend to feel overwhelmed by , and therefore actively avoid , large crowds . They do not necessarily dislike being with people sometimes , but their need for privacy and time to themselves is much greater than for individuals who score high on this scale . Your level of gregariousness is high . Assertiveness . High scorers Assertiveness like to speak out , take charge , and direct the activities of others . They tend to be leaders in groups . Low scorers tend not to talk much and let others control the activities of groups . Your level of assertiveness is high . Activity Level . Active individuals lead fast - paced , busy lives . They move about quickly , energetically , and vigorously , and they are involved in many activities . People who score low on this scale follow a slower and more leisurely , relaxed pace . Your activity level is high . Excitement - Seeking . High scorers on this scale are easily bored without high levels of stimulation . They love bright lights and hustle and bustle . They are likely to take risks and seek thrills . Low scorers are overwhelmed by noise and commotion and are adverse to thrill - seeking . Your level of excitement - seeking is average . Cheerfulness . This scale measures positive mood and feelings , not negative emotions ( which are a part of the Neuroticism domain ) . Persons who score high on this scale typically experience a range of positive feelings , including happiness , enthusiasm , optimism , and joy . Low scorers are not as prone to such energetic , high spirits . Your level of positive emotions is low . Agreeableness Agreeableness reflects individual differences in concern with cooperation and social harmony . Agreeable individuals value getting along with others . They are therefore considerate , friendly , generous , helpful , and willing to compromise their interests with others\\' . Agreeable people also have an optimistic view of human nature . They believe people are basically honest , decent , and trustworthy . Disagreeable individuals place self - interest above getting along with others . They are generally unconcerned with others\\' well - being , and therefore are unlikely to extend themselves for other people . Sometimes their skepticism about others\\' motives causes them to be suspicious , unfriendly , and uncooperative . Agreeableness is obviously advantageous for attaining and maintaining popularity . Agreeable people are better liked than disagreeable people . On the other hand , agreeableness is not useful in situations that require tough or absolute objective decisions . Disagreeable people can make excellent scientists , critics , or soldiers . DOMAIN / FacetScore ￼ AGREEABLENESS38 ￼ ... Trust38 ￼ ... Morality31 ￼ ... Altruism34 ￼ ... Cooperation69 ￼ ... Modesty24 ￼ ... Sympathy50 ￼ Your level of Agreeableness is average , indicating some concern with others\\' Needs , but , generally , unwillingness to sacrifice yourself for others . Agreeableness Facets Trust . A person with high trust assumes that most people are fair , honest , and have good intentions . Persons low in trust see others as selfish , devious , and potentially dangerous . Your level of trust is average . Morality . High scorers on this scale see no need for pretense or manipulation when dealing with others and are therefore candid , frank , and sincere . Low scorers believe that a certain amount of deception in social relationships is necessary . People find it relatively easy to relate to the straightforward high - scorers on this scale . They generally find it more difficult to relate to the unstraightforward low - scorers on this scale . It should be made clear that low scorers are notunprincipled or immoral ; they are simply more guarded and less willing to openly reveal the whole truth . Your level of morality is low . Altruism . Altruistic people find helping other people genuinely rewarding . Consequently , they are generally willing to assist those who are in need . Altruistic people find that doing things for others is a form of self - fulfillment rather than self - sacrifice . Low scorers on this scale do not particularly like helping those in need . Requests for help feel like an imposition rather than an opportunity for self - fulfillment . Your level of altruism is average . Cooperation . Individuals who score high on this scale dislike confrontations . They are perfectly willing to compromise or to deny their own needs in order to get along with others . Those who score low on this scale are more likely to intimidate others to get their way . Your level of cooperation is high . Modesty . High scorers on this scale do not like to claim that they are better than other people . In some cases this attitude may derive from low self - confidence or self - esteem . Nonetheless , some people with high self - esteem find immodesty unseemly . Those who are willing to describe themselves as superior tend to be seen as disagreeably arrogant by other people . Your level of modesty is low . Sympathy . People who score high on this scale are tenderhearted and compassionate . They feel the pain of others vicariously and are easily moved to pity . Low scorers are not affected strongly by human suffering . They pride themselves on making objective judgments based on reason . They are more concerned with truth and impartial justice than with mercy . Your level of tender - mindedness is average . Conscientiousness Conscientiousness concerns the way in which we control , regulate , and direct our impulses . Impulses are not inherently bad ; occasionally time constraints require a snap decision , and acting on our first impulse can be an effective response . Also , in times of play rather than work , acting spontaneously and impulsively can be fun . Impulsive individuals can be seen by others as colorful , fun - to - be - with , and zany . Nonetheless , acting on impulse can lead to trouble in a number of ways . Some impulses are antisocial . Uncontrolled antisocial acts not only harm other members of society , but also can result in retribution toward the perpetrator of such impulsive acts . Another problem with impulsive acts is that they often produce immediate rewards but undesirable , long - term consequences . Examples include excessive socializing that leads to being fired from one\\'s job , hurling an insult that causes the breakup of an important relationship , or using pleasure - inducing drugs that eventually destroy one\\'s health . Impulsive behavior , even when not seriously destructive , diminishes a person\\'s effectiveness in significant ways . Acting impulsively disallows contemplating alternative courses of action , some of which would have been wiser than the impulsive choice . Impulsivity also sidetracks people during projects that require organized sequences of steps or stages . Accomplishments of an impulsive person are therefore small , scattered , and inconsistent . A hallmark of intelligence , what potentially separates human beings from earlier life forms , is the ability to think about future consequences before acting on an impulse . Intelligent activity involves contemplation of long - range goals , organizing and planning routes to these goals , and persisting toward one\\'s goals in the face of short - lived impulses to the contrary . The idea that intelligence involves impulse control is nicely captured by the term prudence , an alternative label for the Conscientiousness domain . Prudent means both wise and cautious . Persons who score high on the Conscientiousness scale are , in fact , perceived by others as intelligent . The benefits of high conscientiousness are obvious . Conscientious individuals avoid trouble and achieve high levels of success through purposeful planning and persistence . They are also positively regarded by others as intelligent and reliable . On the negative side , they can be compulsive perfectionists and workaholics . Furthermore , extremely conscientious individuals might be regarded as stuffy and boring . Unconscientious people may be criticized for their unreliability , lack of ambition , and failure to stay within the lines , but they will experience many short - lived pleasures and they will never be called stuffy .

Neuroticism Freud originally used the term neurosis to describe a condition marked by mental distress , emotional suffering , and an inability to cope effectively with the normal demands of life . He suggested that everyone shows some signs of neurosis , but that we differ in our degree of suffering and our specific symptoms of distress . Today neuroticism refers to the tendency to experience negative feelings . Those who score high on Neuroticism may experience primarily one specific negative feeling such as anxiety , anger , or depression , but are likely to experience several of these emotions . People high in neuroticism are emotionally reactive . They respond emotionally to events that would not affect most people , and their reactions tend to be more intense than normal . They are more likely to interpret ordinary situations as threatening , and minor frustrations as hopelessly difficult . Their negative emotional reactions tend to persist for unusually long periods of time , which means they are often in a bad mood . These problems in emotional regulation can diminish a neurotic\\'s ability to think clearly , make decisions , and cope effectively with stress . At the other end of the scale , individuals who score low in neuroticism are less easily upset and are less emotionally reactive . They tend to be calm , emotionally stable , and free from persistent negative feelings . Freedom from negative feelings does not mean that low scorers experience a lot of positive feelings ; frequency of positive emotions is a component of the Extraversion domain .

Openness to Experience Openness to Experience describes a dimension of cognitive style that distinguishes imaginative , creative people from down - to - earth , conventional people . Open people are intellectually curious , appreciative of art , and sensitive to beauty . They tend to be , compared to closed people , more aware of their feelings . They tend to think and act in individualistic and nonconforming ways . Intellectuals typically score high on Openness to Experience ; consequently , this factor has also been called Culture or Intellect . Nonetheless , Intellect is probably best regarded as one aspect of openness to experience . Scores on Openness to Experience are only modestly related to years of education and scores on standard intelligent tests . Another characteristic of the open cognitive style is a facility for thinking in symbols and abstractions far removed from concrete experience . Depending on the individual\\'s specific intellectual abilities , this symbolic cognition may take the form of mathematical , logical , or geometric thinking , artistic and metaphorical use of language , music composition or performance , or one of the many visual or performing arts . People with low scores on openness to experience tend to have narrow , common interests . They prefer the plain , straightforward , and obvious over the complex , ambiguous , and subtle . They may regard the arts and sciences with suspicion , regarding these endeavors as abstruse or of no practical use . Closed people prefer familiarity over novelty ; they are conservative and resistant to change . Openness is often presented as healthier or more mature by psychologists , who are often themselves open to experience . However , open and closed styles of thinking are useful in different environments . The intellectual style of the open person may serve a professor well , but research has shown that closed thinking is related to superior job performance in police work , sales , and a number of service occupations .
